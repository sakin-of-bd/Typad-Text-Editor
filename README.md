# Typad-Text-Editor

I have developed Typad, a fully functional text editor built using Java Swing. The app features essential text manipulation functionalities, such as creating, opening, editing, saving, and printing text documents. It also includes undo/redo, cut/copy/paste, and font zoom controls, alongside a smooth user interface. The project demonstrates proficiency in Java, GUI development, and file handling, delivering an efficient and user-friendly tool for text editing tasks.
